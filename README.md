This repository is for the paper "The Local Galactic Transient Survey applied to an Optical Search for Directed Intelligence" by Alex Thomas. It is associated with manuscript number AAS55049R1.

This repository can generate a majority of the figures shown in the paper. It tells this story in order; from simple flux calculations to signal-to-noise calculations that are beyond the scope of the paper including other unused figures along the way. It is open source and we hope it is useful for your purposes.
